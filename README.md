## What is Caveman Linux?
In a nutshell, Caveman Linux is a Linux distribution aimed at providing a quality experience to beginners. We provide sane defaults out of the box so that users won't have to spend time manually configuring and setting many things up. 

## Why Caveman?

### Main Features: 
- GNOME with our improvements!
- Insanely fast package management!
- An extremely reliable AUR helper 
- Stable!
- based on Arch Linux
- designed for beginners to Linux
- simple user interface design

### Why Arch?
We believe that Arch Linux is an amazing choice because of it's rolling release model. Users won't have to upgrade to a "Caveman Linux 2", which means people won't have to deal with the hassle of upgrading. We also believe that the AUR can assist beginners in getting their environment set up, because of the high package count. 

If it exists, its probably on the AUR!

### Isnt Arch too Advanced?
There is a stigma about how Arch Linux is a challenging distribution to beginners. As Caveman Linux developers, we try to make the process as user friendly as possible. We believe that the power of Arch Linux can bring a whole new level of computing, and we would like to bring that to you. It's like giving Arch Linux some training wheels, so you can begin to understand Linux.
